      @afni_refacer_run [-deface] T1w-dataset-name
    
    * This script re-faces one input dataset, using a master shell dataset to
       write over the subject's 'face' region.
    * The single command line argument is the name of a T1-weighted dataset.
    * This script has no options.
    * This is NOT a 'defacer' since it replaces the face instead of removing it!
    * This script relies on two datasets that are included with AFNI binaries:
        MNI152_2009_template_SSW.nii.gz = MNI skull strip/warp template
        afni_refacer_shell.nii.gz       = dataset to replace face region
      The latter dataset was made with the script @afni_refacer_make_master.
    * NOTE: Here 'face' also includes part of the skull,
            so the head will be reshaped and the ears replaced.
    
    OPTION:
    -------
     -deface   = Replace the computed 'face' voxels with all zeros instead
                 of the artificial face.
