    Small program to calculate how to evenly space a certain number of
    slices within each view plane of a dset.  Returns three numbers: the
    'delta slices' in the three view planes (in the order of the input
    dset's orientation).
    
    ++ constructed by PA Taylor (NIMH, NIH, USA).

Inputs
++++++

.. code-block:: none

    
      + a volume dset (to have a grid/dimensions)
      + the montage's x- and y-dimensions
      + the choice of either IJK or XYZ coordinates to be output
    

Outputs
+++++++

.. code-block:: none

    
      + three numbers: either 'i j k' or 'x y z' values.  These numbers
        represent where to tell AFNI to set its crosshairs for a montage.
        These can be redirected to a file, if so desired for scripting 
        (likely!).
