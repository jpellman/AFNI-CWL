     
     This program is for calculating the Dice coefficient between two
     volumes on a slice-by-slice basis.  The user enters two volumes on the
     same grid, and Dice coefficients along each axis are calculated; three
     separate text (*.1D) files are output.
     
     The Dice coefficient (Dice, 1945) is known by many names and in many
     applications.  In the present context it is defined as follows.
     Consider two sets voxels (i.e., masks), A and B.  The Dice coefficient
     D is the ratio of their intersection to their union. Let N(x) be a
     function that calculates the number of voxels in a set x. Then:
     
         D = 2*N(intersection of A and B)/(N(A) + N(B)).
     
     The range of D is 0 (no overlap of A and B at all) to 1 (perfect
     overlap of A and B), inclusively.
     
     This program calculates D in a slicewise manner across all 3 major
     axes of a dset; other programs of interest for a volumewise Dice
     coefficient or more general overlap calculations include 3dABoverlap,
     for example.
     
     Nonzero values in a dset are considered part of the mask.  3dcalc
     might be useful in creating a mask from a dset if things like
     thresholding are required.

USAGE
=====

.. code-block:: none

     
         Input: 
           + two single-volume datasets
     
         Output:
     
           + three text files, each a *.1D file of columns of numbers (and
             note that the executed 3dSliceNDice command is echoed into a
             comment in the top line of each 1D file by output). File name
             indicates along which axis the particular results were
             calculated, such as ending in '0_RL.1D', '1_AP.1D', '2_IS.1D',
             etc.
     
             For each file, there are currently 5 columns of data output,
             in the following order:
             [index] the i, j, or k index of the slice (starting from 0).
             [coord] the x, y, or z coordinate of the slice.
             [size of A ROI] the number of voxels in set A's ROI in the slice.
             [size of B ROI] the number of voxels in set B's ROI in the slice.
             [Dice coef] the Dice coefficient of that slice.
     
             1dplot can be useful for viewing output results quickly.

.. code-block:: none

     
         3dSliceNDice                                  \
             -insetA    AA                             \

         where
     
       -insetA    AA   :name of an input set to make a mask from; mask will
                        be made from nonzero values in AA;
       -insetB    BB   :name of an input set to make a mask from; mask will
                        be made from nonzero values in BB;
     
       -prefix    PP   :prefix of output files.
                        Three output text files will be named
                        according to the orientation of the input AA
                        and BB files.  So, outputs might look like:
                          PP_0_RL.1D or PP_0_RL.1D,
                          PP_1_AP.1D or PP_0_PA.1D,
                          PP_2_IS.1D or PP_0_SI.1D.
     
       -out_domain all|AorB|AandB
                       :optional specification of the slices over which to
                        output Dice coefficient results along each axis,
                        via keyword.  Argument options at present:
                        'all':   report Dice values for all slices (default);
                        'AorB':  report values only in slices where sets A or
                                 B (or both) have at least one nonzero voxel;
                        'AandB': report values only in slices where both sets
                                 A and B have at least one nonzero voxel;
                        'Amask': report values only in slices where set A 
                                 has at least one nonzero voxel;
                        'Bmask': report values only in slices where set B 
                                 has at least one nonzero voxel;
     
       -no_cmd_echo    :turn OFF recording the command line call to
                        3dSliceNDice in the output *.1D files (default is
                        to do the recording).

.. code-block:: none

     
       1. Report slicewise overlap of two masks through full FOV along each 
          axis.
            3dSliceNDice                  \
                -insetA mask_1.nii.gz     \
                -insetB mask_2.nii.gz     \
                -prefix mask_olap_all
     
       2. Report slicewise overlap of two masks only for slices where both 
          dsets have >0 voxels in their masks
            3dSliceNDice                  \
                -insetA mask_1.nii.gz     \
                -insetB mask_2.nii.gz     \
                -out_domain AandB         \
                -prefix mask_olap_AandB
     
       To view the SliceNDice results: NB, you can use 1dplot for viewing
       either of the about output results, choosing slice number or DICOM
       coordinate value for the abscissa (x-axis) value.
     
       # use integer index values along x-axis of the plot, for one
       # encoding direction of the volume:
       1dplot -x mask_olap_all_1_PA.1D'[0]' mask_olap_all_1_PA.1D'[4]'
     
       # use DICOM coordinate values along x-axis of the plot: 
       1dplot -x mask_olap_all_1_PA.1D'[1]' mask_olap_all_1_PA.1D'[4]'
