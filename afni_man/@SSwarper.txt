    
    This script has dual purposes for processing a given subject's
    anatomical volume:
        + to skull-strip the brain, and
        + to calculate the warp to a reference template/standard space.
    Automatic snapshots of the registration are created, as well, to help
    the QC process.
    
    This program cordially ties in directly with afni_proc.py, so you can
    run it beforehand, check the results, and then provide both the
    skull-stripped volume and the warps to the processing program.  That
    is convenient!

USAGE
=====

.. code-block:: none

    
        @SSwarper          \
            -input  AA        \
            -base   BB        \
            -subid  SS        \
           {-odir   OD}       \
           {-minp   MP}       \
           {-nolite}          \
           {-skipwarp}        \
           {-unifize_off}     \
           {-init_skullstr_off}  \
           {-SSopt 'strings'  \
           {-aniso_off}       \
           {-verb}            \
           {-noclean}
    
    where:
    
      -input  AA :(req) an anatomical dataset, *not* skull-stripped, with
                  resolution about 1 mm.
    
      -base   BB :(req) a base template dataset, with contrast similar to
                  the input AA dset, probably from some kind of standard
                  template.
                  NB: this dataset is not *just* a standard template,
                  because it is not a single volume-- read about its
                  composition in the NOTES on the 'The Template Dataset',
                  below.
                  The program first checks if the dset BB exists as
                  specified; if not, then if just the filename has been
                  provided it searches the AFNI_GLOBAL_SESSION,
                  AFNI_PLUGINPATH, and afni bin directory (in that order)
                  for the named dataset.
    
      -subid  SS :(req) name code for output datasets (e.g., 'sub007').
    
      -odir   OD :(opt) output directory for all files from this program
                  (def: directory of the '-input AA').
    
      -minp   MP :(opt) minimum patch size on final 3dQwarp (def: 11).
    
      -nolite    :(opt) Do not use the '-lite' option with 3dQwarp;
                  This option is used for backward compatibility, if you want
                  to run 3dQwarp the same way as older versions of @SSwarper.
                  The new way (starting Jan 2019) is to use the '-lite'
                  option with 3dQwarp to speed up the calculations.
                  (def: use '-lite' for faster calculations).
    
      -skipwarp  :(opt) Do not compute past the output of anatSS.{subid}.nii.
                  This option is used if you just want the skull-stripped
                  result in original coordinates, without the warping
                  to the template space (anatQQ). The script will run faster.
    
      -deoblique :apply obliquity information to deoblique the input
                  volume ('3dWarp -deoblique -wsinc5 ...'), as an initial step.
                  This might help when data sets are very... oblique.
    
      -giant_move :when starting the initial alignment to the template,
                  apply the same parameter expansions to 3dAllineate that
                  align_epi_anat.py does with the same option flag.  This
                  might be useful if the brain has a very large angle away
                  from "typical" ones, etc.
    
      -unifize_off :(opt) don't start with a 3dUnifize command to try reduce
                  effects of brightness inhomogeneities.  Probably only
                  useful if unifizing has been previously performed on the
                  input dset.
    
      -aniso_off :(opt) don't preprocess with a 3danisosmooth command to
                  try reduce effects of weird things (in a technical
                  sense).  Possible that this will never be used in the
                  history of running this program.
    
      -init_skullstr_off :(opt) don't preprocess with a 3dSkullstrip command
                  to roughly isolated brain in the beginning.  This might
                  be useful with macaque dsets.
    
      -SSopt 'strings' :(opt) The content of 'strings' (which should be
                  in quotes if there are any blanks) is copied to the
                  end of the 3dSkullStrip command line. Example:
                    -SSopt '-o_ply Fred.Is.Wonderful'
                  to have 3dSkullStrip produce a .ply surface file
                  as an additional output.
    
      -verb      :(opt) Apply the '-verb' option to 3dQwarp, to get more
                  verbose progress information - mostly used for debugging.
    
      -noclean   :(opt) Do not delete the 'junk' files at the end of
                  computations - mostly used for debugging and testing.

REFERENCE DATASETS
==================

.. code-block:: none

    
    If you are reading this message, then several reference data sets
    (base volumes) for @SSwarper now exist within the AFNI realm. Oh, what
    a time it is to be alive.  A current list includes:
    
    + MNI152_2009_template_SSW.nii.gz
    + TT_N27_SSW.nii.gz
    + HaskinsPeds_NL_template1.0_SSW.nii.gz
    
    Some of these are distributed with the AFNI binaries, and other may be
    found online. You can make other reference base templates in whatever
    space you prefer, but note that it must have several subvolumes of
    information included-- see NOTES on the 'The Template Dataset', below
    (which also contains a link to the @SSwarper template tutorial online
    help).
    
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    

OUTPUTS
=======

.. code-block:: none

    
    Suppose the -prefix is 'sub007' (because you scanned Bond, JamesBond?).
    Then the outputs from this script will be"
    
      anatDO.sub007.nii       = deobliqued version of original dataset;
                                (*only if* using '-deoblique' opt);
      anatU.sub007.nii        = intensity uniform-ized original dataset
                                (or, if '-unifize_off' used, a copy of orig dset);
      anatUA.sub007.nii       = anisotropically smoothed version of the above
                                (or, if '-aniso_off' used, a copy of anatU.*.nii)
      anatS.sub007.nii        = first pass skull-stripped original dataset
                                (or, if '-init_skullstr_off' used, a copy of
                                anatUA.*.nii);
      anatSS.sub007.nii       = second pass skull-stripped original dataset;
                                * note that anatS and anatSS are 'original'
                                  in the sense that they are aligned with
                                  the input dataset - however, they have been
                                  unifized and weakly smoothed: they are
                                  stripped versions of anatUA; if you want
                                  a skull-stripped copy of the input with
                                  no other processing, use a command like
                                    3dcalc -a INPUTDATASET        \
                                           -b anatSS.sub007.nii   \
                                           -expr 'a*step(b)'      \
                                           -prefix anatSSorig.sub007.nii
      anatQQ.sub007.nii       = skull-stripped dataset nonlinearly warped to
                                the base template space;
      anatQQ.sub007.aff12.1D  = affine matrix to transform original dataset
                                to base template space;
      anatQQ.sub007_WARP.nii  = incremental warp from affine transformation
                                to nonlinearly aligned dataset;
      AMsub007.jpg            = 3x3 snapshot image of the anatQQ.sub007.nii
                                dataset with the edges from the base template
                                overlaid -- to check the alignment;
      MAsub007.jpg            = similar to the above, with the roles of the
                                template and the anatomical datasets reversed.
    
    * The .aff12.1D and _WARP.nii transformations need to be catenated to get
      the full warp from orginal space to the base space; example:
        3dNwarpApply -nwarp 'anatQQ.sub007_WARP.nii anatQQ.sub007.aff12.1D' ...
    
    * It is important to examine (at least) the two .jpg snapshot images to
      make sure that the skull-stripping and nonlinear warping worked well.
    
    * The inputs needed for the '-tlrc_NL_warped_dsets' option to afni_proc.py
      are (in this order):
        anatQQ.sub007.nii anatQQ.sub007.aff12.1D anatQQ.sub007_WARP.nii
    
    * When B-O-B uses this script for skull-stripping plus warping, He
      gives afni_proc.py these options (among others), after running
      @SSwarper successfully -- here, 'subj' is the subject
      identifier:

      |  if( "$tpath" == "" ) exit 1

NOTES

The Template dataset
++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: none

    
      Any reference base template dataset, such as
      MNI152_2009_template_SSW.nii.gz, must have the first *4* volumes here
      (and can have the optional 5th for later uses, as described):
        [0] = skull-stripped template brain volume
        [1] = skull-on template brain volume
        [2] = weight mask for nonlinear registration, with the
              brain given greater weight than the skull
        [3] = binary mask for the brain
        [4] = binary mask for gray matter plus some CSF (slightly dilated)
              ++ this volume is not used in this script
              ++ it is intended for use in restricting FMRI analyses
                 to the 'interesting' parts of the brain
              ++ this mask should be resampled to your EPI spatial
                 resolution (see program 3dfractionize), and then
                 combined with a mask from your experiment reflecting
                 your EPI brain coverage (see program 3dmask_tool).
    
      More information about making these (with scripts) is provided on
      the Interweb:
        https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/htmldoc/template_atlas/sswarper_base.html
    

You Know My Methods, Watson
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: none

    
      #1: Uniform-ize the input dataset's intensity via 3dUnifize.
           ==> anatU.sub007.nii
      #2: Strip the skull with 3dSkullStrip, with mildly agressive settings.
           ==> anatS.sub007.nii
      #3: Nonlinearly warp (3dQwarp) the result from #1 to the skull-on
          template, driving the warping to a medium level of refinement.
      #4: Use a slightly dilated brain mask from the template to
          crop off the non-brain tissue resulting from #3 (3dcalc).
      #5: Warp the output of #4 back to original anatomical space,
          along with the template brain mask, and combine those
          with the output of #2 to get a better skull-stripped
          result in original space (3dNwarpApply and 3dcalc).
           ==> anatSS.sub007.nii
      #6  Restart the nonlinear warping, registering the output
          of #5 to the skull-off template brain volume (3dQwarp).
           ==> anatQQ.sub007.nii (et cetera)
      #7  Use @snapshot_volreg3 to make the pretty pictures.
           ==> AMsub007.jpg and MAsub007.jpg
    

Temporary files
+++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: none

    
      If the script crashes for some reason, it might leave behind files
      whose names start with 'junk.SSwarper' -- you should delete these
      files manually.
