    
        This program extracts info from BIDS formatted json files created
        with dcm2niix_afni or dcm2niix. This is mostly for internal use as a
        python library. It will also extract fields from any json formatted file.
    

Caveats
=======

.. code-block:: none

    
        This assumes that the json file was converted from dicoms using
        dcm2niix_afni or dcm2niix with the -b (BIDS) option. So a json file and
        matching dataset should be present.
    

Example
=======

.. code-block:: none

    
        abids_json_info.py -TR -json my_bids_fmri.json
    
    

Options
=======

.. code-block:: none

    
    Required arguments:
      -json JSON [JSON ...]
                            Specify .json file(s).
    
    BIDS specific arguments:
      -TR                   Print the TR from the json file in seconds, from the
                            "RepetitionTime" field.
      -TE                   Print out the "EchoTime" field in milliseconds (the
                            json file stores it in seconds)
      -TE_sec               Print the "EchoTime" field in seconds
      -match_nii            Is there a .nii or .nii.gz file that matches the .json
                            file? (1 if the dataset is loadable)
    
    Optional arguments:
      -field STR [STR ...]  Print any field or list of fields from the json file.
      -list_fields          Print a list of the available fields from the .json
                            file. (This must be the only argument specified)
