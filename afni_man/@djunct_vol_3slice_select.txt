    j, k) indices for a dset.  Essentially stealing sage advice written by
    DR Glen in a helpful Message Board post.
    
    Run this program by entering exactly 4, space-separated arguments:
        the name of a file, and then 3 coordinates (x, y, z).
    
    Program returns 3 indices: 
        i j k
    (which can be redirected into a variable or file, for example).
    
    If any of 'i j k' are outside the dset's matrix, return an error.
