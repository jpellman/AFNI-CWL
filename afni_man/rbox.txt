    args (any order, space separated):                    Version: 2001/06/24
      3000    number of random points in cube, lens, spiral, sphere or grid
      D3      dimension 3-d
      c       add a unit cube to the output ('c G2.0' sets size)
      d       add a unit diamond to the output ('d G2.0' sets size)
      l       generate a regular 3-d spiral
      r       generate a regular polygon, ('r s Z1 G0.1' makes a cone)
      s       generate cospherical points
      x       generate random points in simplex, may use 'r' or 'Wn'
      y       same as 'x', plus simplex
      Pn,m,r  add point [n,m,r] first, pads with 0
    
      Ln      lens distribution of radius n.  Also 's', 'r', 'G', 'W'.
      Mn,m,r  lattice(Mesh) rotated by [n,-m,0], [m,n,0], [0,0,r], ...
              '27 M1,0,1' is {0,1,2} x {0,1,2} x {0,1,2}.  Try 'M3,4 z'.
      W0.1    random distribution within 0.1 of the cube's or sphere's surface
      Z0.5 s  random points in a 0.5 disk projected to a sphere
      Z0.5 s G0.6 same as Z0.5 within a 0.6 gap
    
      Bn      bounding box coordinates, default 0.5
      h       output as homogeneous coordinates for cdd
      n       remove command line from the first line of output
      On      offset coordinates by n
      t       use time as the random number seed(default is command line)
      tn      use n as the random number seed
