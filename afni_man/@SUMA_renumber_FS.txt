        commands, or it can be run separately for data that had been
        processed using older versions of AFNI.
    
        Originally written and tested on FreeSurfer (FS) v5.3 output from
        default running of 'recon-all'. This should now work for FS v6.0
        default running of 'recon-all', as well.

OUTPUTS
=======

.. code-block:: none

    
        This program will take the aparc+aseg.nii.gz and
        aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz parcellation files produced by FreeSurfer
        (FS) and converted to NIFTI by @SUMA_Make_Spec_FS, and make the
        following related data sets (with the same prefix) for each: 
    
            + A copy of the whole parcellation/segmentation and renumber the
              ROIs to be smaller (for colorbar representation); this file
              is called "*_REN_all.nii.gz".
    
            + Tissue segmentation maps (not binary, but containing the
              renumbered ROI values), based on our best guesses of of what
              each is, from both the 'mri_binarize' command in FS and our
              own supplementary reading of the ROI names. The following
              files are output:
    
                *_REN_gm.nii.gz     :gray matter
                *_REN_wmat.nii.gz   :white matter
                *_REN_csf.nii.gz    :cerebrospinal fluid
                *_REN_vent.nii.gz   :ventricles and choroid plexus
                *_REN_othr.nii.gz   :optic chiasm, non-WM-hypointens, etc.
                *_REN_unkn.nii.gz   :FS-defined "unknown", with voxel value >0
    
                ... and, added in Nov, 2019, more dsets for convenience in
                afni_proc.py and FATCAT processing:
    
                *_REN_gmrois.nii.gz :gray matter ROIs without '*-Cerebral-Cortex' 
                                     dots.  This ROI file might be more
                                     useful for tracking or for making
                                     correlation matrices than
                                     *_REN_gm.nii.gz, because it doesn't
                                     include the tiny scattered bits of the 
                                     '*-Cerebral-Cortex' parcellation.
    
                fs_ap_wm.nii.gz     :mask (not map!) of WM, excluding the dotted
                                     part from FS.  Useful for including in 
                                     afni_proc.py for tissue-based regressors.
    
                fs_ap_latvent       :mask (not map!) of the lateral ventricles,
                                     '*-Lateral-Ventricle'.  Useful for
                                     including in afni_proc.py for
                                     tissue-based regressors.
    
            + A labeltable of the new ROI values: "*_REN_all.niml.lt".
              This labeltable is attached to each of the *_REN_*.nii.gz
              files.
    
    

RUNNING
=======

.. code-block:: none

    
        At the moment, the function just takes a single, required
        argument, which is the location of the 'SUMA/' directory created
        by @SUMA_Make_Spec_FS.  The program also requires being able to
        see the two 'afni_fs_aparc+aseg_*.txt' files in the AFNI binary
        directory: that is where the information on renumbering the FS
        ROIs is).
    
            $ @SUMA_renumber_FS SUMA_DIR
    
        where SUMA_DIR is either the full or relative path to the 'SUMA/'
        directory (including that directory name).
    
        But again, note that this program will mainly just be run by
        @SUMA_Make_Spec_FS.
