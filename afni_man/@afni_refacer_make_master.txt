    
    Usage:
       @afni_refacer_make_master list-of-datasets
    
    * This script makes a new mask/shell dataset for use with
       @afni_refacer_run. You probably do not need to run this script.
    * This script has no options. The command line should be
       a list of T1-weighted dataset names that have NOT been
       skull-stripped or defaced or refaced.
    * The output is a dataset afni_refacer_shell.nii.gz that
       contains the average 'face', which will be applied in
       script @afni_refacer_run.
    * Where I say 'face', I mean 'non-brain tissue', which includes
       some skull regions, thus altering the outer shape of the
       head to some extent (including the ears).
    * A minimum of 9 input datasets is required; 20 is probably
       enough to produce a master for refacing purposes.
    * This script depends on the existence of two datasets:
       MNI152_2009_template_SSW.nii.gz = MNI-space skull stripping template
       afni_refacer_MNIbmask10.nii.gz  = MNI-space dilated brain mask
    * These datasets should be in the AFNI executable directory, and are
       supplied with the pre-compiled AFNI binaries.
    * The first dataset is used (by @afni_refacer_make_onebigA12 and
       @afni_refacer_run) to align a dataset to MNI space
    * The second dataset is used to mask off the brain region when making
       the output dataset afni_refacer_shell.nii.gz
    * Modifying this script, and the other @afni_refacer_XXX scripts, to
       use a different template will require replacing the two datasets
       listed above appopriately.
    * And possibly modifying the 3dcalc command 'extend it downwards',
       below.
