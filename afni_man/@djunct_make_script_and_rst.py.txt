    
    Program to take a script with some special (~simple) markup and turn
    it into both an RST page and a script for the online Sphinx
    documentation.
    
    

INPUTS
======

.. code-block:: none

    
    -prefix_rst AA    :(req) output filename, including any path, of the
                       RST/Sphinx file.  AA must include file extension 
                       '.rst'.  E.g.:  tutorial/fun_3dcalc.rst
    
    -prefix_script BB :(req) output filename, *without* any path, of the
                       script file.  BB probably should include file extension, 
                       such as '.tcsh'.  E.g.:  fun_3dcalc.tcsh
    
    
    -reflink       CC :(req) a string tag that will be 1) subdirectory name
                       holding images for the given demo, and 2) the RST 
                       internal reference label, as '.. _CC:'.  First character
                       of CC must be alphabetic.
    
    -execute_script   :(req/opt) flag to not just create the RST+script, but
                       to execute the script as well.  IF the script
                       generates images that will be copied to the
                       media/CC/. directory, then this flag should be used
                       at least the first time the script is run (so the
                       files can be copied); it may not be necessary to
                       execute on later runs.
     
    

OUTPUTS
=======

.. code-block:: none

    
    + an RST file, which is basically a Sphinx-formatted page, that can be
      placed in a separate directory
    
    + an output directory to put into the Sphinx tree, called
      [rst-path]/media/CC, where [rst-path] is the location of the output
      RST file and CC is the reflink name.
    
    + a script file, both locally (where the script is run, so that it can
      be executed) and in [rst-path]/media/CC (which will be shown in the
      RST pages).
    
    + images made by the script which are flagged to be show in the RST
      pages will be copied to [rst-path]/media/CC/. 
    
    

EXAMPLES
========

.. code-block:: none

    
       1) First time through, execute script to make images:
       @djunct_make_script_and_rst.py                                          \
           -input          ex_afni11_roi_cmds.tcsh                             \
           -reflink        afni11_roi_cmds                                     \
           -prefix_script  afni11_roi_cmds.tcsh                                \
           -prefix_rst ~/afni_doc/tutorials/rois_corr_vis/afni11_roi_cmds.rst  \
           -execute_script
    
       2) Second time through, if "only" text changes/formatting:
       @djunct_make_script_and_rst.py                                          \
           -input          ex_afni11_roi_cmds.tcsh                             \
           -reflink        afni11_roi_cmds                                     \
           -prefix_script  afni11_roi_cmds.tcsh                                \
           -prefix_rst ~/afni_doc/tutorials/rois_corr_vis/afni11_roi_cmds.rst
